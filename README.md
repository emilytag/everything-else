# everything-else
Most code written in a sleepless fit before assignment deadlines

CV-HMM: a hidden markov model over characters in a word to generate consonant and vowel pattern, done to practice implementing an HMM from scratch
EM: implementation of expectation maximization
DBM: implementation of a deep boltzmann machine for MNIST
nb-sentiment: a very quick implementation of a sentiment classifier using naive bayes
nn-feedforward: implementation of a 1 and 2 layer feed forward neural net for MNIST
rbm-autoencoder: implementation of a restricted boltzmann machine and autoencoder for MNIST
